# audio-library-testing
checklist 
1. Think about ways to choose the most important/informative words. Currently TF-IDF without a library and weighting all words.
2. improve the forward audio playback speed quality
   - Remove audio clicks
   - Make words more clear
   - Check that the playback speed matches the speed of words being said. ex. play a single word at 1x speed
